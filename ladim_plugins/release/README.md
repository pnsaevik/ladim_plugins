# Release

The module is used to generate release files for ladim. 


## Usage

Release files are generated by running the `makrel` shell script,

```
makrel <conf> <out>
```

the `ladim_plugins.release` main module,

```
python -m ladim_plugins.release <conf> <out>
```

or by calling the `make_release` function directly,

```
from ladim_plugins.release import make_release
release = make_release(conf, out)
```

The argument `out` is the name of the output file. Defaults to
`None` (no file output, only in-memory return value).

The argument `conf` is a dict or a `.yaml` file. See the comments in
[release.yaml](./release.yaml) for details. 

The function returns a dict with the generated release data. If a file name is given, the data
is written to a tab-delimited text file with no headers. The columns will be in
the same order as the dict returned by the function.

## History

Let output be sorted by release date, as ladim requires date sorting to work
